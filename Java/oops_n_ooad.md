## Object-Oriented Analysis

Object-oriented analysis is a method of analysis that examines requirements from the perspective of the classes and objects found in the vocabulary of the problem domain.

The primary tasks in object-oriented analysis (OOA) are:

- Identifying objects

- Organizing the objects by creating object model diagram

- Defining the internals of the objects, or object attributes

- Defining the behavior of the objects, i.e., object actions

- Describing how the objects interact
