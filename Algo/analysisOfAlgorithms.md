# Algorithm Design Canvas

The Algorithm Design Canvas captures our process for tackling algorithm design problems.It's the most convenient way to represent algorithmic thinking. Every algorithmic problem, big or small, easy or hard, should eventually end up as a completed canvas.

The Canvas contains 5 major areas: Constraints, Ideas, Complexities, Code, and Tests. 

## Constraints

The Constraints area is where you fill in all constraints of the problem. This includes things like how large the input array can be, can the input string contain unicode characters, is the robot allowed to make diagonal moves in the maze, can the graph have negative edges, etc.

Your very first task when analyzing an algorithm design problem is to uncover all its constraints and write them down.

## Ideas

After identifying all constraints, go into idea generation. Typically during an interview discuss 1 to 3 ideas. Often times start with one, explain it to the interviewer, and then move on to a better idea.

Your next goal is to fill in a succinct description of your idea: short and sweet so that any interviewer is able to understand it.

## Complexities

Each idea has two corresponding Complexity areas: Time and Memory. For every algorithm you describe, you will need to be able to estimate its time and memory complexity.

## Code

After you've identified the problem's constraints, discussed a few ideas, analyzed their complexities, and found one that both you and your interviewer think is worth being implemented, you finally go into writing code.

## Tests

Finally, you move on to writing test cases and testing your code. Many people completely ignore this step. This is not smart at all.
