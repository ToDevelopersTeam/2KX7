 
 Design Principle
 ================
--> Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

Take what varies and “encapsulate” it so it won’t affect the rest of your code. The result? Fewer unintended consequences from code changes and more flexibility in your systems!

--> Program to an interface, not an implementation.

--> Favor composition over inheritance.
	When you put two classes together in a HAS-A relationship you’re using composition. Creating systems using composition gives you a lot more flexibility. Not only does it let you encapsulate a family of algorithms into their own set of classes, but it also lets you change behavior at runtime as long as the object you’re composing with implements the correct behavior interface.
	
Strategy Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
