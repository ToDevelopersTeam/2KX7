# Distributed System

A collection of independent computers that appear to its users as one computer.

**Three Characteristics**

- The computers operate concurrently

- The computers fail independently

- The computers do not share a global clock

## Read Replication

- Complexity

- Consistency

## Sharding

- More Complexity

- Limited data model

- Limited data access patterns

## Consistent Hashing

---

## Distibuted Computation

- Scatter/Gather
- MapReduce
- Hadoop
- Spark
- Storm

## Hadoop

- MapReduce API
- MapReduce job management
- Distributed FileSystem (HDFS)
	- Files and directories
	- Metadata managed by a replicated master
	- Files stored in large, immutable, replicated blocks
- Enormous Ecosystem

Hadoop is built in java.

Hbase: Column family database built on top of HDFS
Hive: SQL like Query structure data
Mahout: Machine Learning system built on top of Hadoop
