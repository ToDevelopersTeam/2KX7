# Why 2kx7 failed?

- did not practiced enough coding on various sections of data structures.
	- String and arrays (terribly failed in complex problems of this section. Still that sluggishness haunts me)
	- hash table 
	- matrix (did not solved much problems here)
	- graph
	
- did not understood even basics of dynamic programming.
- not able to solve complex algorithms problems.

- took a lot of tension/ stress during the preparation, a light headed mind could have made results a bit more positive.
	- Taking tension, feeling stressed does not work. It never works. I thought the more seriously I will try the more focussed I will become. But I was wrong, terribly, pathetically wrong.

- Luck may work once or even twice but never the third time.	
	
- I got stressed over the problems during interviews, that's why did not quite solved it in right time sometimes and in other cases could not even solve it. I heard interviewers saying to me "We are running out of time." These words even doubled the stress and my thinking at that time gone haywire.
	
- Problems should be solved with an open mind. Never even think of the solution first, forget about the optimised one. Just try to understand the problem without taking any stress over it. Try to visualize the problem, may be even draw some rough diagram. This can/will trigger mind into active thinking mode which will help in solving the problem. Now start with the very basic case of the problem like null or single input. Solving this case will be very easy as it does not require much processing and you can write the code for this in the very next moment. Now increase the size of the input to make it a more general case and solve it. Think of various data structures like array, stack, queue, linked list, hash table that you can use of store the intermediate contents considering the space complexity. If you are able to solve the problem in brute force manner, now may be the time to reduce the time complexity and the optimize the solution.
