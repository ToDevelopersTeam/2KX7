# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

​A content delivery network (CDN) is a collection of global servers that caches and delivers content such as images, videos and Javascript files. When a user requests a web page, for instance, content on that page is delivered by the closest edge server rather than the origin server, thereby decreasing page load time.

​A CDN is a distributed group of servers that can withstand high amounts of traffic, provide inexpensive data transfer costs, and provide reliability. Many websites and online services rely on CDNs as a cost-effective way to improve uptime and performance.

## ​EXAMPLE OF A CDN

Many websites use third-party libraries like Twitter Bootstrap to improve their layout or functionality. However, the administrator may not want to host the libraries directly, which costs bandwidth and may involve maintenance and updates.

Services like Bootstrap CDN let users load the CSS and Javascript files for Twitter Bootstrap from a CDN. This reduces server load and speeds up access for users. Additionally, users can avoid re-downloading the files if they’ve already visited a site that uses the same files on Bootstrap CDN.

​A CDN offers numerous benefits for a website or online service:

- **Users experience faster load times** because assets are downloaded from local servers instead of faraway ones.
- **Enterprises save on bandwidth costs** since CDNs can purchase bandwidth in bulk and pass this discounted rate to their customers.
- **Enterprises reduce server load** because asset requests are routed away from the origin server.
- **Enterprises improve server reliability** as CDNs are part of failover plans to route traffic to new locations should a server be taken offline
