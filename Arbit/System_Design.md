# System Design

Designing a high-level architecture for some sort of a software system.

## Some examples

- Design a URL shortening service like bit.ly.

- How would you implement the Google search?

- Design a client-server application which allows people to play chess with one another.

- How would you store the relations in a social network like Facebook and implement a feature where one user receives notifications when their friends like the same things as they do?

The idea of these questions is to have a discussion about the problem at hand. Whatâ€™s important for the interviewer is the process, which you use to tackle the problem. The typical outcome of such a discussion is a high-level architecture addressing the goals and constraints in the question. Perhaps the interviewer will choose one or more areas where they will want to discuss bottlenecks and other common problems.


## Scaling

Vertical scaling :  increasing processors (cores, caches), DISK, RAM
