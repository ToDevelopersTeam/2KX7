Job searching is a variated task. It will have many sides to it. You will get opportunites, you will lose opportunites and sometimes the opportunites might revisit. In all these situations consistency is the key. You have to be consistent with your preparation, your thoughts and most importantly knowledge. Whatever you have learned, you must go deeper in that with every passing moment. Dive deep, should understand all the things associated with it.

I started off with a good notion but a bit slow pace. I was enthusiastic about the idea of getting good company but lacked determination and endurance to withstand the preparation required for the same. It all started with switching to a company where there was less work and more life balance. The thoughts that wandered during those times were that if I can get more time to myself, can get myself more for the study. I had to go back from the basics to high end knowledge for all those topics that are required to clear a tech interview. I am not talking about another typical IT interview to switch company, get a bit of hike and move on with life. No, this was different and it has to be different because I needed a complete paradigm shift to my thinking. 

It was somewhere middle of 2016 that I started taking this pursuit more seriously. I purchased one of the heavy books on algorithms, CLRS; thinking that would form the core part of my preparation but as you will see it actually did not. I started going through the book deep, trying to grasp each and every word. In the beginning it was good, very good. The book started with sorting algorithms and in not much time I was able to grasp them. During those times, I thought this might turn out to be a easy, a bit lengthy but not that much strenuous. Days went by as I proceeded further through the book, sometimes I had to skip few topics because either they were too much academic and not required from the point of interview or they were over my head, complete bouncer as we say in cricket.
