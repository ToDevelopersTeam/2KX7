## Making the Right Architecture Decisions

Most of the architecture decisions you make will be a tradeoff of these factors:

-Time: How long it takes you to setup
-Team: How productive your team will be with this decision
-Cost: How much you'll pay to AWS for these services
-Risk: How much down time / data loss / security risk you're exposed to
-Scale: How many users you can serve / how fast your app is
