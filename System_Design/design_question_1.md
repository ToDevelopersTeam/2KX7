### Design a Traffic Signalling System

# DESCRIPTION

City 'X' is suffering from traffic problem. Since the number of cars and two-wheelers on the road is increasing, commuting from one part of the city to another at any point of the day has become a matter of concern for everyone.

Therefore the transportation management authority has decided to redesign the traffic signaling system for the city. 
Your task in this problem is to help them design an efficient system which will resolve each of the following concerns:

- What are the points you will consider before the start of your project?
- Once you have finalized all the important points, what are the design principle you will follow?
- What kind of system would you choose to develop the system? Explain in brief about the pros and cons of your selected system?
- Describe the High-Level Design of your system using Flowchart or Wireframes. 
- Write the code for a road intersection, make it generic enough both in terms of colors, and ordering, so what it can be used anywhere.

- Note: A road intersection may have many traffic lights one for each side of the roads

Note:
You can drag and drop images in the text area to upload it
You can use free tools like https://www.draw.io/ for the wireframes, flow chart, etc
If you are using https://www.draw.io/, make sure you export it as an image.
