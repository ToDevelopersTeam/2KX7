# Problems to practice
---

- Design a Vending Machine which can accept different coins, deliver different products?

- You have a Smartphone class and will have derived classes like IPhone, AndroidPhone,WindowsMobilePhone can be even phone names with brand, how would you design this system of Classes.

- Design ATM Machine

- Design a Lift system in your programming language.

- Design and implement LRU cache.

- Design a Traffic Controller System for a Junction

-  Filesystem Design

- Cards game design 

- Restaurant/hotel booking system

## Parking lot Design

**Assumptions**

- The parking lot has multiple levels. Each level has multiple rows of spots.
- The parking lot can park motorcycles, cars, and buses.
- The parking lot has motorcycle spots, compact spots, and large spots.
- A motorcycle can park in any spot.
- A car can park in either a single compact spot or a single large spot.
- A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within the same row. It cannot park in small spots.

- Design Uber low level OO design. Cater to use cases like search for a ride, different category of rides, select a ride, registration for a user and driver, paying for ride etc.

- Design the classes for a Battleship Game. Write the attack function.

- Design a deck of cards that can be used for different card game applications. Please code out what you would need for the deck class and a card class. Implement a deal method.

- Model the Animal kingdom as a class system, for use in a Virtual Zoo program.

	Possible sub-issues: do they know the animal kingdom at all? (I.e. common sense.) What properties and methods do they immediately think are the most important? Do they use abstract classes and/or interfaces to represent shared stuff? How do they handle the multiple-inheritance problem posed by, say, a tomato (fruit or veggie?), a sponge (animal or plant?), or a mule (donkey or horse?)

- Create a class design to represent a filesystem.

	Do they even know what a filesystem is, and what services it provides? Likely classes: Filesystem, Directory, File, Permission. What's their relationship? How do you differentiate between text and binary files, or do you need to? What about executable files? How do they model a Directory containing many files? Do they use a data structure for it? Which one, and what performance tradeoffs does it have?

- Design an OO representation to model HTML.

	How do they represent tags and content? What about containment relationships? Bonus points if they know that this has already been done a bunch of times, e.g. with DOM. But they still have to describe it.
	
- Design a parking garage.
- Design a bank of elevators in a skyscraper.
- Model the monorail system at Disney World.
- Design a restaurant-reservation system.
- Design a hotel room-reservation system.
