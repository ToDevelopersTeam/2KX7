The Power Xpert Gateway 900 (PXG) is a powerful tool for monitoring electrical systems. Delivers real-time, Web-enabled monitoring of electrical distribution and control equipment. 

The Power Xpert® Gateway 900 (PXG 900) has been designed to be installed in electrical assemblies or systems—low- and medium-voltage switchgear, switchboards, panelboards, transfer switches, and motor control centers to acquire and consolidate data available from components such as trip units, meters, relays, drives, and I/O. 

It can also serve as a data aggregation point if used with Eaton's Power Xpert Insight or third party software.

Security:
---

Password protection and management

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) as part of any access control
effort. To support this, the PXG 900 has a robust set of tools you
can use to create the set of users and role-based permissions as
well as a comprehensive set of password management features

Secure Web browsing

SSL Encryption option ensures that information and passwords exchanged with the PXG’s Web server cannot be intercepted on the LAN

Protocols

incom

The Eaton Cutler-Hammer INCOM (INdustrial COMmunications) Network is designed to
provide two-way communication between a network master and a variety of Cutler-Hammer
products such as breakers, digital meters, or motor overload relays. 

- Carrier generation and detection
- Data modulation/demodulation
- Address decoding
- Generation and checking of a 5-bit cyclic redundant BCH error code 

What is Modbus?

Modbus is a serial communication protocol developed by Modicon published by Modicon® in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs). In simple terms, it is a method used for transmitting information over serial lines between electronic devices. The device requesting the information is called the Modbus Master and the devices supplying information are Modbus Slaves.

Modbus is an open protocol, meaning that it's free for manufacturers to build into their equipment without having to pay royalties.

serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a communication channel or computer bus. This is in contrast to parallel communication, where several bits are sent as a whole, on a link with several parallel channels.

The basic difference between a parallel and a serial communication channel is the number of electrical conductors used at the physical layer to convey bits.
