# Stacks and Queues

Stacks and queues are dynamic sets in which the element removed from the set
by the DELETE operation is prespecified. In a stack, the element deleted from
the set is the one most recently inserted: the stack implements a last-in, first-out,
or LIFO, policy. Similarly, in a queue, the element deleted is always the one that
has been in the set for the longest time: the queue implements a first-in, first-out,
or FIFO, policy.
