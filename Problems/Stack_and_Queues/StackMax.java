@Problem
Design a stack that supports a max operation, which returns the maxi¬
mum value stored in the stack, and throws an exception if the stack is empty. Assume
elements are comparable. All operations must be 0(1) time. You can use 0(n) addi¬
tional space, beyond what is required for the elements themselves.
