/***
 @problem
   Write a program that takes a reference to the head of a singly linked list
   and returns null if there does not exist a
   cycle, and the reference to the start of the cycle, if a cycle is present.
   (You do not know the length of the list in advance.)

 @hint
   Consider using two iterators, one fast and one slow.
